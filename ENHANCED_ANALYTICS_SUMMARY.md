## 📈 Reputation Scoring System

Users earn reputation points through activity:

| Activity | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Post an answer | +5 |
| Answer accepted | +15 |
| Create knowledge item | +10 |
| Receive upvote | +2 |
| Receive downvote | 0 (doesn't subtract) |

**Formula** (in SQL):
```sql
(answers * 5) + (accepted_answers * 15) + (knowledge_items * 10) + (upvotes * 2)
```

Top contributors are ranked by this score.

## 🔄 Real-time Updates

The analytics refresh when you:
- Navigate to the Analytics tab
- Reload the page

**Note**: Charts don't auto-refresh in real-time. User must manually refresh to see latest data.

**Future Enhancement**: Add auto-refresh every 30-60 seconds with Supabase real-time subscriptions.

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Empty State**: If you see zeros, add test data:
   - Ask some questions
   - Post answers
   - Upvote content
   - Create user connections
   - Share knowledge items

2. **Verify Charts Render**: Check browser console for errors

3. **Check SQL Functions**: Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_engagement_metrics();
   SELECT * FROM get_trending_topics(7);
   SELECT * FROM get_top_contributors(10);
   ```

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### **Charts not appearing:**
- Open browser DevTools → Console
- Look for Chart.js errors
- Verify `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` are installed:
  ```bash
  npm list chart.js react-chartjs-2
  ```

### **"Function does not exist" error:**
- SQL migration hasn't been run
- Run `18_enhanced_analytics.sql` in Supabase

### **Zero data everywhere:**
- Database is empty (normal for new projects)
- Add test data through the app

### **Type errors:**
- Run: `npm install --save-dev @types/chart.js --legacy-peer-deps`
