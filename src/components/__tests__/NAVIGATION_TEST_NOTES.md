# Navigation Test Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Original Problem
Attempted to create comprehensive navigation tests for `App.tsx` but encountered persistent Vitest mocking issues:

### Symptoms
- Error: `[vitest] No "Dashboard" export is defined on the "../Dashboard" mock`
- Occurs even with correct mock syntax
- Affected all 17 navigation tests (NAV-001 through NAV-007)

### Attempted Fixes
1. **Named function mocks**: Used `const MockComponent = () => <div/>` pattern
2. **Arrow function mocks**: Used `() => ({ default: () => <div/> })` pattern
3. **Import ordering**: Moved mocks before App import
4. **Multiple mock syntaxes**: Tried various Vitest mock configurations

### Root Cause - IDENTIFIED ✅
The issue was a **mismatch between import and export styles**:
- `App.tsx` imports components as **named exports**: `import { Dashboard } from './components/Dashboard'`
- Component files export **both named and default**: `export function Dashboard()` + `export default Dashboard`
- Original mocks only provided **default exports**: `vi.mock('../Dashboard', () => ({ default: () => <div/> }))`

When `App.tsx` tries to use `Dashboard` as a named import, Vitest couldn't find it in the mock because only `default` was defined.

## Solution ✅
Provide **both named and default exports** in the mock:

```typescript
vi.mock('../Dashboard', () => ({
  Dashboard: () => <div data-testid="dashboard-component">Dashboard Component</div>,
  default: () => <div data-testid="dashboard-component">Dashboard Component</div>,
}));
```

This ensures that:
1. Named imports work: `import { Dashboard }` ✅
2. Default imports work: `import Dashboard` ✅
3. Both reference the same mock component ✅

## Result ✅
**All 17 Navigation tests now passing!**
- NAV-001: Navigate to Dashboard (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-002: Navigate to Knowledge Search (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-003: Navigate to Expert Finder (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-004: Navigate to Project Connections (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-005: Navigate to Insights Hub (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-006: Navigate to Messages (2 tests) ✅
- NAV-007: Active nav state (3 tests) ✅
- Additional Navigation Tests (2 tests) ✅

## Lessons Learned
- Always check **how the component is imported** in the target file
- Match the mock export style to the import style
- For maximum compatibility, provide **both named and default exports** in mocks
- Component files with dual exports (`export function X` + `export default X`) need special attention

## Files Fixed
- `src/components/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx` - All tests passing (17/17) ✅

## Date
- Created: 2024 (after multiple debugging iterations)
- **Resolved: October 24, 2025** ✅
