---

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (5 minutes)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251029_advanced_ai_features.sql`
5. Paste and click **Run**
6. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

**Verify tables created:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'smart_notifications',
  'ai_connection_suggestions', 
  'notification_preferences',
  'work_pattern_analysis',
  'activity_log',
  'project_members',
  'projects'
);
```

Should return 7 rows.

---

### Step 2: Enable Real-time (2 minutes)

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Database** → **Replication**
2. Find `smart_notifications` → Toggle **ON**
3. Find `ai_connection_suggestions` → Toggle **ON**

---

### Step 3: Test Locally (5 minutes)

Start the dev server:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

**Expected:**
- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ No red errors in browser console (F12)
- ✅ You might see warning: "Graph API not configured" (this is OK)

---

### Step 4: Deploy (Optional)

The app is ready to deploy as-is:

```powershell
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder is ready for deployment to:
- Vercel
- Netlify  
- Azure Static Web Apps
- GitHub Pages

---

## 🎯 Using the New Features

### Without Microsoft Graph API (Works Now)

Even without configuring Graph API, you get:

✅ **Smart Connection Suggestions** - AI analyzes work patterns
✅ **Smart Notifications** - Alerts for similar work
✅ **Work Pattern Analysis** - Background AI analysis
✅ **Activity Logging** - Track user activities

⚠️ **Presence Detection** - Shows "Offline" (needs Graph API)
⚠️ **Meeting Scheduler** - Shows error message (needs Graph API)

**This is graceful degradation - app works, advanced features require Graph API.**

---

### With Microsoft Graph API (Optional Setup)

To enable **full Teams integration**:

1. Follow `ADVANCED_AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Section "Microsoft Graph API Setup"
2. Create Azure AD app registration
3. Get Client ID, Tenant ID, Client Secret
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_GRAPH_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
VITE_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
VITE_GRAPH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
```

5. Restart: `npm run dev`

Then you'll have:
✅ Real-time presence (Available/Busy/Away)
✅ Automated Teams meeting creation
✅ Calendar integration
✅ Availability checking

## 📊 Quick Health Check

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if migration ran
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%smart%' OR table_name LIKE '%ai_%';
-- Should return: 3+ tables

-- Check real-time is enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
-- Should include: smart_notifications, ai_connection_suggestions

-- Test activity logging function
SELECT log_user_activity(
  (SELECT id FROM profiles LIMIT 1),
  'test_action',
  'test_entity',
  NULL,
  '{"test": true}'::jsonb
);
-- Should return: UUID
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build fails with "Cannot find module"
**Fix:** 
```powershell
rm -r node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Issue: "relation does not exist" in Supabase
**Fix:** Run the migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: App shows blank page
**Fix:** 
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check `.env.local` has Supabase credentials
3. Restart dev server

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Fix:** Already fixed! Run `npm run build` to verify
