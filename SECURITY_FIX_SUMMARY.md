# Security Fix Applied ✅

## Summary
Successfully migrated hardcoded Supabase credentials to environment variables.

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 Security Issue
- **File:** `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx`
- **Problem:** Hardcoded Supabase Project ID and Anon Key (JWT token)
- **Risk:** Credentials exposed in source code and version control

### ✅ Solution Applied
- Moved credentials to environment variables
- Added proper error handling for missing env vars
- Created `.env.example` template for team
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/supabase/info.tsx`**
   - Now reads `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from env vars
   - Added validation to fail fast if env vars are missing
   - Automatically extracts project ID from URL

2. **`.env.example`** (NEW)
   - Template file for environment variables
   - Safe to commit (contains no real credentials)

3. **`SECURITY_UPDATE.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete documentation of changes
   - Setup instructions for team members
   - Deployment guidelines

## Verification

✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed without errors  
✅ Environment variables detected from `.env` file  
✅ `.gitignore` already includes `.env` (credentials protected)  
✅ No breaking changes to existing code  

## Next Steps for Team

1. Ensure your `.env` file exists (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
3. Update environment variables in deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## Security Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Credentials in source code | ✅ Credentials in `.env` (git-ignored) |
| ❌ Same keys for all developers | ✅ Each developer can use their own keys |
| ❌ Risk of accidental exposure | ✅ Protected from version control |
| ❌ Hard to change environments | ✅ Easy dev/staging/prod switching |
