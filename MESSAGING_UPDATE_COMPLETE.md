# ‚úÖ Messaging Now Restricted to Connected Users Only

## Summary
Successfully implemented connection-based messaging restrictions. Users can now only message people they've connected with.

## Changes Deployed

### 1. Database Function Update ‚úì
**File:** `supabase/migrations/32_filter_conversations_by_connections.sql`
- Modified `get_user_conversations()` function
- Added INNER JOIN with `user_connections` table
- Filters by `status = 'connected'`
- Bidirectional connection check (works both ways)

### 2. Frontend Validation ‚úì
**File:** `src/components/Messages.tsx`
- Added connection check in `startNewConversation()`
- Validates connection before allowing new conversations
- User-friendly error: "You must connect with this user first. Visit the Experts tab to send a connection request."

### 3. Documentation ‚úì
**File:** `MESSAGING_CONNECTION_FILTER.md`
- Complete migration guide
- Testing instructions
- Rollback procedures

## What Changed

### Before:
```
Messages Tab ‚Üí Shows ALL user conversations
New Message ‚Üí Can message ANYONE by email
```

### After:
```
Messages Tab ‚Üí Shows ONLY conversations with connected users
New Message ‚Üí Can ONLY message users you're connected with
             ‚Üí Shows helpful error if not connected
```

## User Flow

1. **Go to Experts Tab** ‚Üí Find someone to connect with
2. **Send Connection Request** ‚Üí Wait for acceptance
3. **Connection Accepted** ‚Üí Status changes to 'connected'
4. **Go to Messages Tab** ‚Üí Now you can message that person! üìß

## Database Schema
```sql
user_connections table:
- user_id: UUID (who initiated)
- connected_with: UUID (who received)
- status: 'connected' | 'pending' | 'rejected'
- created_at: timestamp

Connection check (bidirectional):
WHERE (user_id = A AND connected_with = B) 
   OR (user_id = B AND connected_with = A)
  AND status = 'connected'
```

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Frontend:** Deployed to GitHub Pages  
‚úÖ **Code:** Committed and pushed to main  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Database:** Migration SQL created - needs manual run in Supabase Dashboard

## Next Step: Apply Database Migration

**You need to run the SQL migration in Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Copy contents of: `supabase/migrations/32_filter_conversations_by_connections.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. ‚úÖ Done! The function is now updated

**Why manual?** - Supabase CLI needs project linking, easier to run directly in dashboard.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Test conversation list only shows connected users
- [ ] Test new message to non-connected user shows error
- [ ] Test new message to connected user works
- [ ] Verify existing conversations still work

## Build Info
